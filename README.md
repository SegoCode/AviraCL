This batch tool allows you to scan and delete malware from your computer using the powerful Avira core antivirus engine. Also includes an updater to ensure that you are always using the latest malware database. To run the command line antivirus, you typically need to have Avira antivirus installed... However, you do not need to install Avira antivirus to use the script.

This tool is based on a previous project that I removed from GitHub because it was approached differently. But this version is improved and I hope you find it useful. 

## Features
- Portable.
- Custom Scan to select specific folders or files to scan
- Configuration settings such as file types to scan 
- Malware database updates

## Usage & info

Things to keep in mind: 

- Works better with internet
- Need a avira license file
- Highly recommended to run the script in an empty folder
