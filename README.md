This tool lets you scan for malware on your computer or in a specific folder using Avira's antivirus engine. It also has an updater for the malware database. Usually, you need to have Avira antivirus installed to run the command line antivirus, but you can use the script without installing Avira antivirus.

_Is based on a previous project that I removed from GitHub because it was approached differently. But this version is improved and I hope you find it useful._ 

## Features
- Portable.
- Custom Scan to select specific folders or files to scan
- Configuration settings such as file types to scan 
- Malware database updates

## Usage & info

Things to keep in mind: 

- Works better with internet
- Need a avira license file
- Highly recommended to run the script in an empty folder

```shell
git clone https://github.com/SegoCode/AviraCL
